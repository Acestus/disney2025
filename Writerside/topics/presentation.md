# Disney Cruise Vacation

I jotted a few ideas for a Disney Cruise vacation. I would love to do it with the homeschool group. It would be a memorable experience for the kids. 

### Building Community and Making Memories

Friendships for Life: On Disney cruises, kids have the chance to meet and connect with others throughout the voyage. These friendships often last a lifetime, creating a sense of community that extends beyond the ship.

Our Personal Experience: Madeline and I sailed on the Disney Magic in January, and it was a trip filled with wonder and joy. We want our kids to share in these memories.

### The Perfect Deck: Quiet and Convenient

Deck Choice: We’ve requested connected rooms on the sixth deck. This location offers tranquility, surrounded by other staterooms. It’s easy to access both the main deck and dining areas without relying on elevators—perfect for staying active during the cruise.

### Culinary Delights and Nostalgic Shows

Dining Themes: The onboard dining experiences are nothing short of extraordinary. Each theme immerses you in wonder, from elegant feasts to whimsical character encounters.

Nostalgic Entertainment: The shows transport you back to classic Disney moments. Whether it’s Broadway-style performances or deck parties, the entertainment is sure to delight.

The shows and entertainment were wonderful. There's a level of technical work and artistry to the big stage shows I wasn't expecting and they were all lovely.

### Musical Memories and Romantic Escapes

Shipwide Melodies: Disney pipes music throughout the ship, evoking cherished memories. It’s like walking through scenes from our favorite films.

Palo: A Romantic Haven: For couples, Palo offers unadulterated time alone. Our own Palo experience felt like a honeymoon dinner—a special moment that lingers in our hearts.

I would recommend DCL for a married couple without children. The ship is architected to keep the adult only areas free of children. It is a great first time cruise experience.

Castaway Cay, is absolutely beautiful and is worth the time and effort.

Being on a Disney cruise feels like being able to teleport back into the parks during the early 2000’s. It’s peak Disney.
